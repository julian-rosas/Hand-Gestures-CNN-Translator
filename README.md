## ðŸš€ Usage

### âœ… Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for Exploration)

1. Look at ðŸ““ [Getting Started Notebook](GettingStarted.ipynb) for a detailed explanation.

### âœ… Option 2: Using the Terminal (Headless Mode)

1. Make sure dependencies are installed:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Ensure dataset files are placed in the following paths:

    ```
    ./input/train/sign_mnist_train.csv
    ./input/test/sign_mnist_test.csv
    ```

3. Run the training and evaluation:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
